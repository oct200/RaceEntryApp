A client-server application which allows an administrator to sign up racers to races, based on their bikes' cubic capacity.
The application was fully developed in both Java and C#. Any client can connect to any server regardless of language, confirming protocol consistency and cross-platform compatibility.
Through this project, I developed a deeper understanding of logging mechanisms, the use of configuration files, and the implementation of reliable client-server communication. 

Technologies used:
  - Java + Gradle + Sqlite database
  - C# + Sqlite database
  - Sockets and json protocol, used for the communication between the server and the client

Functionalities:
  - adding a new racer
  - signing up a racer for a race, based on their bikes' power output
  - filtering racers by team
  - filtering races by CC
